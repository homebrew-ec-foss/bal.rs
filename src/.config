=> how to add new algorithm ?
    update the enum `Algorithm` in main.rs and also add you algorithm to `match` in line 60
    add `your_algorithm.rs` file to `lb/algos` and update lb/algos.rs (pub mod `your_algorithm`;)
    you can call your algorithm in `match` in `lb.rs`. To access servers, use config.servers. To access weights (if requried), use config.weights. Refer `config` structure in main.rs for more info
